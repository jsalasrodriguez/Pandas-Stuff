Combo Class Python Script
	Query returns Combo class students

	Baseball card report from SWUN save as BBSwun.csv, script does not read column names other than Student Id 
	so columns can have whatever name you want. Script creates a new column named SWUN Score to combine the scores into one column
	the order of the SWUN Baseball report shoudl be Student Id, Current Grade, grades k-6 scores remeber to include grade 2 paper pencil
	and grade 2 online. 
	
	Baseball card report from SWUN save as BBSwun.csv, for this report you need Student Id and Composite Level

	The Script then joins the query, SWUN, and Dibels on Student Id.

*** Note you can add future tests to track in the script by creating a new function you will then need join on Student Id to the other parts.
